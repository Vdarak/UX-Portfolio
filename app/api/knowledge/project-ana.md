# ANA: AI-Powered News Aggregator

## Project Overview
ANA is an AI-driven news aggregation system designed to help Gen Z users navigate media bias and enhance their media literacy. The project combines AI detection with educational tools to make media consumption more transparent and trustworthy.

## Problem Statement
Gen Z audiences struggle with:
- Media bias in news sources
- Difficulty in evaluating source credibility
- Information overload without context
- Lack of understanding about how bias affects news

## Solution
An explainable AI system that:
- Detects and categorizes media bias across news sources
- Provides transparency into AI decision-making
- Educates users about bias patterns and media literacy
- Empowers informed consumption habits

## Key Features
- **Bias Detection**: AI model identifies media bias across political, cultural, and narrative dimensions
- **Explainability**: Shows users WHY the system detected bias, not just that it exists
- **Contextual Learning**: Educational overlays teach media literacy concepts
- **Source Credibility**: Tracks source reliability metrics over time
- **Personalization**: Adapts to user interests while avoiding filter bubbles

## My Role
- Conducted extensive UX research to understand Gen Z media consumption
- Designed the explainability layer for complex AI outputs
- Created intuitive interfaces for bias visualization
- Tested designs with target users to validate effectiveness
- Collaborated with ML engineers to ensure AI outputs were suitable for UI display

## Design Challenges
- **Complexity**: Translating complex AI concepts into simple UI
- **Trust**: Building credibility for an AI system
- **Engagement**: Making media literacy engaging rather than preachy
- **Performance**: Efficient processing of real-time news data

## Key Methodologies
- User Research (interviews, surveys)
- Usability Testing
- AI/ML collaboration
- Iterative design refinement
- A/B testing of explainability approaches

## Outcomes
- Achieved 78% user understanding of bias categories
- 85% of users found explainability helpful
- Successfully engaged Gen Z demographic in media literacy

## Technical Stack
- React/TypeScript frontend
- AI bias detection models (backend)
- Responsive design for mobile-first audience
- Real-time data processing

## Future Directions
- Browser extension for real-time bias detection
- API for integration with existing news platforms
- Community fact-checking layer
- Advanced personalization without filter bubbles
