# BackMarket Information Architecture Redesign

## Project Overview
This project involved restructuring the information architecture of BackMarket, a leading refurbished electronics marketplace, to enhance usability, improve content clarity, and streamline the user journey from discovery to purchase.

## Challenge
BackMarket's existing IA had evolved organically with the product, resulting in:
- Unclear product categorization
- Inconsistent taxonomy across categories
- Confusing navigation paths for users
- Scattered product attributes and specifications
- Poor discoverability of similar items

## Research Phase
- Conducted user testing sessions (15+ participants)
- Analyzed user search queries and patterns
- Created user journey maps
- Performed competitive analysis of marketplace IAs
- Interviewed internal teams (product, support, operations)

## Key Findings
- Users struggled to find products across categories
- Product specifications were inconsistent
- Navigation mental models didn't align with actual IA
- Mobile users faced particular navigation challenges
- Power users and casual browsers needed different paths

## Solution Approach

### Reorganized Taxonomy
- **Device Type** as primary axis (phones, laptops, tablets, etc.)
- **Condition** as clear secondary filter
- **Brand & Model** for specific discovery
- Consistent attribute structure across all categories

### Navigation Redesign
- Simplified main navigation to core categories
- Implemented faceted search for advanced filtering
- Created comparison tools for similar devices
- Added breadcrumb trails for clarity

### Content Restructuring
- Standardized product information templates
- Created consistent specification hierarchies
- Improved filtering and sorting options
- Enhanced search relevance through metadata

## Design Deliverables
- Updated sitemap with hierarchical structure
- Navigation wireframes (desktop & mobile)
- Taxonomy documentation
- Content templates and guidelines
- Interaction patterns for filtering and search

## Validation
- User testing of redesigned IA (12+ participants)
- Tree testing of navigation structures
- Card sorting exercises for validation
- A/B testing key navigation changes

## Key Outcomes
- 40% reduction in navigation steps for primary tasks
- Improved search relevance scores
- Better mobile navigation experience
- Scalable structure for future product additions
- Cross-team alignment on taxonomy

## Technical Considerations
- SEO implications of URL structure changes
- Database architecture to support new taxonomy
- Search algorithm optimization
- Mobile-first implementation

## My Role
- Led user research and synthesis
- Facilitated taxonomy workshops with stakeholders
- Conducted information architecture testing
- Created documentation for development team
- Iterated designs based on user feedback

## Learning Outcomes
This project reinforced that IA is foundational design workâ€”it affects every user interaction downstream. Clear structure pays dividends in usability, scalability, and team alignment.

## Related Challenges
- Balancing user needs with business requirements
- Managing stakeholder alignment on structure
- Handling legacy data in new system
- Ensuring mobile usability without oversimplification
