# About LLME - Vedant Darak

## Introduction
I'm Vedant Darak, a **Design Engineer** with an HCI (Human-Computer Interaction) background. I bridge the gap between design systems and front-end engineering, translating Figma designs into resilient React/TypeScript systems while maintaining accessibility and performance.

## Current Role
**Design Engineering Intern at Cognijin**
- Shaping adaptive workflows and AI-first knowledge tools
- Collaborating with researchers, AI engineers, and product teams
- Building and shipping reusable components that scale from prototypes to production

## My Expertise

### Design Engineering Craft
- Architect component systems and design tokens
- Translate design specifications into React and Next.js implementations
- Prototype interactions with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion
- Validate interaction intent before committing to scale

### Evidence-Led Systems
- Conduct mixed-method research studies
- Instrument prototypes for data collection
- Synthesize telemetry with qualitative insights
- Use data to steer roadmaps and keep releases accountable to user value

### AI-Enabled Experiences
- Collaborate with ML teams on agentic workflows
- Craft explainable UI patterns for AI systems
- Deliver resilient design operations that keep human judgment in the loop
- Work on systems that demystify AI decision-making

## Technical Skills

**Frontend**: React, Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion
**Design Tools**: Figma, Prototyping
**Research**: Mixed-methods, User Interviews, Quantitative Analysis, Usability Testing
**Performance**: Web performance optimization, Accessibility (WCAG)
**Emerging**: AI Integration, Agentic Workflows, LLM Integration

## Projects
I've worked on several impactful projects:

1. **ANA: AI-Powered News Aggregator** - Media bias detection with explainable AI
2. **Understanding Creative Block** - HCI research on creative professionals
3. **BackMarket IA Redesign** - Information architecture restructuring
4. **Reducing Alcohol Consumption** - Behavioral UX for health interventions
5. **Finance Dashboard** - Data visualization for financial management

*For detailed information about specific projects, ask me about them directly and I'll provide comprehensive insights.*

## Beyond Design

When not crafting user experiences, I enjoy:
- **Badminton** - Competitive sport I'm passionate about
- **Nature Adventures** - Exploring outdoors and hiking
- **Poetry** - Writing and sharing poetic thoughts (check out my poetry page)
- **Stock Market Analysis** - Analyzing market trends and financial instruments

These hobbies keep me grounded and often inspire fresh perspectives in my design work.

## Philosophy
**Consistency over Perfection** - This guiding principle ensures that my work maintains quality while remaining practical and iterative. I believe in shipping, learning, and improving rather than pursuing unattainable perfection.

## Values
- **User-Centered**: Always prioritizing user needs and research findings
- **Evidence-Based**: Decisions backed by data and user insights
- **Intentional**: Creating with purpose and clear intent
- **Inclusive**: Building accessible experiences for all users
- **Collaborative**: Working effectively with cross-functional teams

## Let's Connect
